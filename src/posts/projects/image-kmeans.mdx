Image Kmeans is a Webassembly module written in Rust that uses k-means clustering to determine the dominant colours in a provided image. Because it's a Webassembly module the code can be run directly in the client browser with no uploading of the images required. It's also super speedy compared to a pure Javascript implementation of the algorithm. The blog post series I wrote on the creation of this module can be found here: [Part 1](/blog/colour-finder-1), [Part 2](/blog/colour-finder-2), [Part 3](/blog/colour-finder-3)

## Give it a try

Drop an image into the box below and select either fixed or derived K number to see the results:

<ImageKmeansComponent client:load />
