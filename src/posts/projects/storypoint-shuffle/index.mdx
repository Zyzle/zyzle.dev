I created this app as a replacement for the online sprint planning tool my team was using after we ran out of our free trial period :D

The app is deployed at https://storypoint-shuffle.zyzle.dev feel free to use it if you and your team need a similar tool!

## Key features

- **Real Time collaboration**: The app uses WebSockets to enable real-time collaboration between team members during the planning session.
- **Selectable Card Sets**: Choose between Fibonacci or T-Shirt sizing. (More coming soon!)
- **Spectator Mode**: Allow users to join as room spectators without participating in the voting.

## Development

You can find the complete code for the project in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zyzle/storypoint-shuffle).

The project uses the following tech:

### Backend

- [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/): a web application framework for Rust.
- [Socketioxide](https://docs.rs/socketioxide/latest/socketioxide/): a library for building WebSocket servers in Rust.

### Frontend

- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/): a library for real-time web applications.
- Tanstack [React Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest), [React Form](https://tanstack.com/form/latest): I really like the Tanstack libraries, these would be my goto for most personal web projects.
- [Skeleton-React](https://www.skeleton.dev/): a lightweight CSS framework for building responsive UIs.
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/): This was my first time using Vite in a project, really enjoyed working with this.
