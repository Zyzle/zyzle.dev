Simple setup of `venv` for new Python projects, I would always use a local venv for developing in Python as it makes it easier to manage dependencies and work in the app across multiple locations.

> The setup process of venv may have changed since this guide was written, check out the current docs for updates[^1]

```bash showLineNumbers=false
mkdir myproject
cd !$
python3 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
; pip is almost always out of date so upgrade it
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

; git init and ignore env
git init
echo "env/" >> .gitignore
```
