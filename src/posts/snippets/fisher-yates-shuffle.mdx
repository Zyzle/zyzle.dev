The Fisher-Yates shuffle[^1] is an algorithm for generating a random permutation of an array.

[^1]: Learn more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)

The algorithm is defined as follows:

```plaintext showLineNumbers=false
-- To shuffle an array a of n elements (indices 0..n-1):
for i from n−1 down to 1 do
     j ← random integer such that 0 ≤ j ≤ i
     exchange a[j] and a[i]
```

The typescript implementation of the algorithm I normally use is:

```ts title="shuffle.ts"
shuffle(cards: any[]) {
  let m = cards.length;
  let t, i = 0;
  while(m) {
    i = Math.floor(Math.random() * m--);
    t = cards[m];
    cards[m] = cards[i];
    cards[i] = t;
  }
}
```
